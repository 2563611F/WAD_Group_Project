		You've found our about us page! Woo-hoo! Read below to know more about us.
        </strong>
	<p>
		Floppabunny is a small local business maintained by a small group of developers (us) with the
		goal of selling you the most affordable necklaces available at the greatest possible price.
        </p> <br/>
	<p>
		Florence Payne, our founder and current CEO, creates all of our necklaces. She obtains all of the materials for the stunning necklaces
		herself, then develops, designs, and manufactures them all on her own, using only the most cutting-edge technology (her hands).
